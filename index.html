<!-- A ball would appear at a random point on the screen and move across it at a random speed. The ball disappears whenever the mouse hits it and there will be upgrades to more easily block the balls. If the user can't disappear the ball before it hits an edge of the screen they get a point. Ten points and they lose -->
